🏠 Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Python (Pandas)

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on a large Airbnb dataset using Python and Pandas to understand data quality, structure, and patterns. This project demonstrates how raw, unstructured data can be cleaned, transformed, and prepared for meaningful analysis and visualization.


📊 Overview

This EDA process includes:

Initial data inspection using .head(), .info(), and .shape()

Column selection and removal of redundant features

Renaming and standardizing column names

Handling missing values and null records

Identifying and removing duplicate entries

Cleaning and transforming categorical variables

Converting boolean fields into numerical format (0/1)

Cleaning currency fields by removing symbols and commas

Converting price columns to numeric data types

Exporting a clean, analysis-ready dataset



🎯 Goals

Understand the structure and quality of Airbnb listing data

Identify inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates

Prepare a clean dataset for further analysis or visualization

Enable reliable insights through structured and validated data



🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

CSV Dataset (Airbnb Listings)



🧠 Insights

This EDA process helps in:

Identifying data quality issues early in the analysis lifecycle

Understanding missing data patterns across key attributes

Ensuring consistent formats for categorical and numerical fields

Improving dataset usability for dashboards and ML models

Creating a strong foundation for price, location, and host-level analysis
